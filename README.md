# Individual Cyber Security Project

## Final Year Project

### Annectent
#### Easly Setup Zero-trust based VPN (WireGuard)

This goal is to provide a service that anyone can install, operate, and use easily, even for individuals or small businesses. Although many existing services provide it, the problem is that it is difficult to use or install and can cost a lot of money. To solve these problems, I want to provide a small but all-in-one security model by combining light and fast speed with a Zero-trust model based on WireGuard.

The backend consists of Go, and the frontend implements a light and fast service using Svelte. The login page also improves security and ensures stability and availability with AWSâ€™s Cognito and Amplify. It also provides the convenience of making single-sign-on easy to log in.
